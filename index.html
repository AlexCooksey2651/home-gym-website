        <h2>Why Workout at Home?</h2>
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic forced people all around the country to begin working out at home in order to stay physically active. 
        Even though most gyms have now reopened, plenty of people have continued to exercise at home. Even if you normally train at a gym, having a small amount of equipment at home 
        (or at least learning some bodyweight workouts) provides a lot of flexibility for times when you can't get to the gym. Some things to consider:

        <h2>Some Quick Advice</h2>
        <p>
        <em>Safety first.</em> If you have any pre-existing medical conditions or injuries, it might be best to train in an environment where other people
         can help in case of emergency. Likewise, if your training style involves a lot of heavy weightlifting, make sure you know how to safely escape a failed attempt. 
         Damaging your home is better than risking your own well-being. With barbell exercises such as squats or bench presses, use spotter arms (available for most squat racks). 
         Whenever possible, have other people spot you when bench pressing; if alone, <strong>never</strong> never put collars on the bar to secure the weights. 
         Finally, be extra cautious if you have children or pets who might be present. This all might sound extreme, but accidents do happen.
        </p>
        <p>
        Be considerate of the impact your training might have on neighbors, not to mention other people in your own home. This is especially true for those living in apartment complexes, 
        where noise and vibration may travel easily. Even for those training out of a house, slamming weights or blasting your music 
        can make quick enemies out of significant others and neighbors alike!
        </p>
        <p>
        Know your budget, and build your home gym out slowly based on what you need. When it comes to getting in shape, hard work matters way more than fancy equipment. 
        You could get ridiculously fit with just a jump rope, a couple pairs of used dumbbells, and gymnastics rings (all of this would probably set you back no more than $50 combined). 
        As space and money become available, you can always add. You don't need to buy the best of everything, but buy good quality. High-quality equipment will hold up forever with minimal maintenance.  
        You might pay $100 for a well-made, cast-iron kettlebell, but it will probably outlive you, your children, and your grandchildren. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Don't be shy about buying used - check Facebook marketplace, eBay, Craigslist, etc.  If you have particular items you'd like to buy new, keep an eye for deals. Check Amazon Daily Deals or wait for times like
        Black Friday and early January when many companies offer discounts. If you're handy, you can also DIY some equipment or other components like storage.

            Okay, so none of the items listed below is essential. If you like boxing, you might be better off getting boxing gloves and a punching bag instead of a squat rack.
            You also definitely don't need all of these items. The world won't stop turning if you don't use resistance bands. That all said, if your goals revolve around general fitness, you can accomplish just about any goal
            with the equipment listed below:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li class="equipment">Dumbbells</li>
                    Dumbbells are perhaps the most versatile gym equipment and are widely available. A set of <a href="https://powerblock.com/">adjustable dumbbells</a> adjustable dumbbells can be expensive, 
                    but is much cheaper than a full set of fixed-weight dumbbells and takes up way less space.  
                <li class="equipment">Gymnastics Rings/Pullup Bar</li>
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PACEARTH-Gymnastics-Adjustable-Non-Slip-Training/dp/B07CGCD7JH/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=gymnastic+rings&qid=1635883423&qsid=130-6582833-8278567&sr=8-5&sres=B07CGCD7JH%2CB0725P27CP%2CB08N65MSW3%2CB088HJTY6K%2CB08CVD2Q82%2CB07YTJSPHC%2CB081C76MFH%2CB091YN1P22%2CB0832T4G82%2CB08K2J8WM4%2CB08J4618F9%2CB08L4T63G4%2CB0861BPMNK%2CB078GMR7QL%2CB01N9OV05P%2CB08FX8WPGM%2CB094QDNCHN%2CB08L17SLXN%2CB087Q7XMWY%2CB01JYJRX0W">
                        Gymnastics rings</a> are very inexpensive and highly portable, even for travel. Pullups are a missing movement for those relying exclusively on dumbbells, kettlebells, or barbells. 
                    Even if you can't do pullups, hanging can be excellent for developing grip strength and decompressing the shoulders and spine. 
                    Doorway pullup bars are also inexpensive, though <a href="https://www.roguefitness.com/p3-pullup-system">wall-mounted options</a> are more sturdy. Many squat racks also include built-in pullup bars. 
                <li class="equipment">Bench</li>
                    A flat bench will suffice for many people, but <a href="https://www.repfitness.com/benches?cat=651&gclid=Cj0KCQjww4OMBhCUARIsAILndv75fVP-H_VyRtgVmwPzh85QvBRHpTp4tfrIJGddSuJcB_OjmXvf--waAvkAEALw_wcB"> 
                        adjustable benches</a> offer added versatility for a wide variety of upper body exercises. 
                    Benches can also be very helpful for stretching and core work, as well as lower body exercises such as step-ups, box squats, and hip thrusts.
                <li class="equipment">Olympic Barbell</li>
                    Many different types of barbells exist, but a basic 7-foot olympic barbell will do for most people. Top end barbells can cost over $1,000, but 
                    very high <a href="https://www.roguefitness.com/the-ohio-bar-black-zinc?gclid=Cj0KCQjww4OMBhCUARIsAILndv7mJ3X6HSO8l-vls7jk7qSgmr8eT6KS26Y0OO57tpvuNygH9HU1W20aAigAEALw_wcB">quality bars</a> can be had for as little as $200-300. If you like to lift heavy, a quality barbell is essential.  
                <li class="equipment">Weight Plates</li>
                    <a href="https://www.repfitness.com/weightlifting/rep-old-school-iron-plates">Standard iron plates</a> and <a href="https://www.fringesport.com/collections/bumper-plates"> bumper plates</a> are both options. Iron plates will generally cost less, 
                    but if you're planning to do deadlifts or olympic weightlifting movements - which involve dropping weight on the ground - bumper plates are highly recommended. Standard iron plates will suffice for most other needs. 
                <li class="equipment">Squat Rack</li>
                    A <a href="https://www.roguefitness.com/sml-2-rogue-90-monster-lite-squat-stand">squat stand</a> will do just fine for most people, is cheaper, and takes up much less space than a full power rack. Some, like <a href="https://prxperformance.com/pages/profile-rack-v2/?utm_campaign=TOF-Search-Terms-Brand&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc-search&utm_content=profile-rack-v2&utm_campaign=Retargeting-540-Days-Brand-[Search-Terms]&utm_source=Google&utm_medium=Google-Search&gc_id=1567132235&h_ad_id=326812743733&utm_term=prx%20performance&gc_id=1567132235&h_ad_id=326812743733&gclid=Cj0KCQjww4OMBhCUARIsAILndv6oTuUdZJocAQQ6o5wQe0uxXy9vLtUCmI10x8jdf7E9W80GBU0myTgaAponEALw_wcB"> this rack</a> can even fold up against a wall when not in use. 
                <a href="https://www.titan.fitness/racks/power-racks/t-3-series/t-3-series-power-rack/T3-SERIES-RACK.html">Power racks,</a> on the other hand, provide extra stability and an extra peace of mind for safety when performing heavy barbell squats or bench presses. 
                    Many companies offer a wide range of accessories for both squat stands and power racks, greatly improving their versatility - examples include dip bars, or even cable lat pulldown stations. 
                    If these types of accessories are important to you, make sure you investigate compatibility before making your purchase. 
                <li class="equipment">Kettlebells</li>
                    <a href="https://www.kettlebellkings.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjww4OMBhCUARIsAILndv7PDRutiqu4LHAySAT96uDZqhrAgg0bOCh3TwJ7Uf4v8QmWpsm8dxIaAk7tEALw_wcB"> Kettlebells</a> come in a variety of sizes and finishes, but cast-iron should be your choice, especially if you routinely perform more explosive kettlebell movements such as swings, clean and presses, or snatches. 
                    They probably involve a greater learning curve than dumbbells, but are arguably the most versatile gym equipment to someone who spends the time to learn these more advanced techniques. 
                    Kettlebells can be a suitable tool for both strength and cardiovascular training. 
                <li class="equipment">Cardio Equipment</li>
                    If general health and fitness are your main concerns, you should include some sort of cardiovascular training to complement strength training. You can easily get away with no equipment if you like running, bike rides, or playing sports like tennis; 
                    however, having options at home can help if the weather is bad or you prefer low-impact machines. You can stay very cheap with something as simple as a jump rope, but otherwise you can go nuts with all sorts of gadgets like rowing machines, treadmills, ellipticals, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/YOSUDA-Indoor-Cycling-Bike-Stationary/dp/B07D528W98/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=yosuda&qid=1635884268&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&smid=A2XS9KO5PUQHMV&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzODBPVkwySzJJV01TJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjM1NjU2MzdSWkhYTVpMOUFWSiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNDgwNTYwT1hHVkNKOFg3QTYxJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ=="> stationary bicycles</a>. 
                    If I were to choose one piece to train both high intensity and lower-intensity aerobic training, I might recommend a <a href="https://www.roguefitness.com/black-concept-2-rowerg-rower-pm5-black?gclid=Cj0KCQjww4OMBhCUARIsAILndv5_NzaNNXLAJkCHxf5e_LHHJgYxLeQ3RRUp8tiSmN6oXVB8nJSJy0MaAv0iEALw_wcB">rowing machine</a> or an <a href="https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-echo-bike"> airbike</a>. 
                    Finally, while they are generally much more expensive, you might consider connected options like <a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/bike?utm_campaign=26625333&utm_content=315501950&utm_medium=search&utm_source=google_search&gclid=Cj0KCQjww4OMBhCUARIsAILndv5oPFx2P25m9t4gMCzF9BtHLIwAo94UNC72xL3Jn2FJUBHhVDPRHTMaAhGeEALw_wcB"> Peloton</a> or <a href="https://hydrow.com/?g_network=g&g_adid=554148988221&g_acctid=290-519-9158&g_keyword=%2Bhydrow%20%2Brower&g_adtype=search&g_adgroupid=119218743247&g_keywordid=kwd-859964983660&g_campaignid=11898978652&utm_content=text&g_campaign=202012_acq_branded_search+%5BKNOWN%5D&utm_term=%2Bhydrow%20%2Brower&g_type=search&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=202012_acq_branded_search&gclid=Cj0KCQjww4OMBhCUARIsAILndv5YVvZ5IYnwQ72ZaqsYcSsritt6CKYYeK-h2_9l8rE5pOv1hBminlMaAuzLEALw_wcB">Hydrow</a> that allow you to stream classes to help you stay motivated. 
                <li class="equipment">Resistance Bands</li>
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resistance-Gymnastics-Training-Strength-Building/dp/B09DCVZ7B7/ref=sr_1_14?dchild=1&keywords=resistance+bands&qid=1635884422&qsid=130-6582833-8278567&sr=8-14&sres=B088FHSXVW%2CB01AVDVHTI%2CB08V8P48Z6%2CB07YHFC2SG%2CB08C7K77PS%2CB07RLVNST5%2CB07H7QT6BN%2CB012ZWS9DA%2CB08DLXZKF7%2CB09DCVZ7B7%2CB07NXX99JW%2CB08CKHXLW9%2CB081F25FYP%2CB07K1823XB%2CB08LV2JJ1Q%2CB093SWH7C1%2CB087R2Q4HM%2CB081L9MDC8%2CB0971MX9JZ%2CB07DR9BT5G&srpt=EXERCISE_BAND">Bands</a> may not perform as well as free weights, but are cheap and extremely portable for travel. You can also use them to create resistance at different angles than you have when only using free weights, giving you a broader variety of training options. 
                <li class="equipment">Recovery Tools</li>
                    A quick search on Amazon or Google will yield countless expensive recovery gadgets, but you can generally get away with pretty simple options like a good <a href ="https://www.amazon.com/TriggerPoint-Roller-Instructional-Original-13-inch/dp/B008YPZQCU/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&keywords=foam+roller&qid=1635884470&qsid=130-6582833-8278567&sr=8-9&sres=B071P2MQ5D%2CB07G2ZWLD2%2CB07W5CMX7S%2CB01BW2YZ4Q%2CB008YPZQCU%2CB00ED3GIV0%2CB07HCTJ5KR%2CB07HM9DRDZ%2CB085XB9HX6%2CB013OZ5NOA%2CB016NE9A2A%2CB073M1FTQ7%2CB07CRS3TFS%2CB00E9B87FG%2CB006GUCAFG%2CB008N0K84C%2CB00XM2N06O%2CB091PQH1J7%2CB07KFD7KLP%2CB096G7HW46&srpt=MUSCLE_ROLLER">foam roller</a>, lacrosse ball, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trideer-Stretching-Physical-Non-Elastic-Exercise/dp/B092MJ621Z/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=stretch+strap&qid=1635884566&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExWUNZU1NSVUVYUzVMJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDcxNTA4OUNJRUs1Q0FWSlczJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA2MTg1OTgxTU80MFlOMFQ0SUI3JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==">stretch strap</a>. There are also various self-massage tools on the market; perhaps the most familiar are massage guns like the <a href="https://www.therabody.com/us/en-us/home?gclid=Cj0KCQjww4OMBhCUARIsAILndv4wWRzT8uH3DtL-F-B4eWsa2e-dX6vyX6sS6WwrvCCOnLgvGH5u5NYaAh6TEALw_wcB">Theragun</a>. 
                <li class="equipment">Flooring</li>
                    With a simpler set-up, you can probably get away with a yoga mat or something slightly thicker. However, if you train consistetly and have more space, you might consider <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Exercise-Foam-Interlocking-Tiles/dp/B0719B8HQZ/ref=sr_1_12?crid=19VNZ1G2XZ7JV&dchild=1&keywords=gym%2Bmat&qid=1635884701&sprefix=gym%2Bmat%2Caps%2C233&sr=8-12&th=1">interlocking tiles</a>. 
                    If you have a full-fledged garage or basement gym, you can install gym flooring - while expensive, custom options exist, horse stall mats can be picked up for much cheaper and suit the job perfectly well.
                <li class="equipment">Mirrors</li>
                    Mirrors certainly aren't necessary, but you might like being able to see yourself when training to help with perfecting your technique. Be careful that you do not mount them too close to the ground, where weights can roll into them and cause damage. 
                <li class="equipment">Fan/Heater</li>
                    If you work out in a space without great air circulation, air conditioning, or heat during the winter (such as a garage), you might consider investing in equipment that allows you to be reasonably comfortable in your training environment. The garage can be a tough place to train in a Florida summer or Minneapolis winter. 
                <li class="equipment">TV/Speakers</li>
                    Certainly not necessary, but some background noise and entertainment might make long cardio sessions much more enjoyable. Some motivating music might also help you get through a hard set. Just try not to turn your workouts into Netflix bingeing sessions!
                <li class="equipment">Whiteboard, Timer, etc.</li>
                    Some of these miscellaneous tools can make it easier to stay on track with your workouts so you don't have to always be checking your phone in between sets. 
                <li class="equipment">Misc Equipment - Sandbags, Specialty Bars, Squat Rack Attachments</li>
                    A lot of other gym equipment exists out there to help you get in shape - <a href="https://ultimatesandbagtraining.com/the-original-sandbag/">sandbags</a>, <a href="https://www.onnit.com/clubs-and-maces/"> clubs, maces</a>, <a href="https://www.roguefitness.com/weightlifting-bars-plates/barbells/specialty-barbells">specialty bars</a> (e.g. safety squat bars, trap bars, curl bars), the possibilities are literally endless! If you regularly use tools like these, go nuts; just be wary of accumulating too many things that end up collecting dust in a corner. 
                <li class="equipment">Lifting Accessories</li>
                    These are typically just small items like a lifting belt, gloves, chalk, lifting straps, or whatever else you need to get the job done. 
                <li class="equipment">Storage</li>
                    You'll need somewhere to put it all! The big things you might want to consider are shelves for dumbbells and kettlebells, a weight tree to store olympic plates, and bins or shelves for your miscellaneous tools like foam rollers and other accessories.
                <li class="equipment">Decoration</li>
                    Make it your own! One of the biggest advantages of training at home is that you truly get to make it <em>your space</em> - whether you stay minimalist with 
                    bare walls or cover every square inch of wall space with motivating posters, artwork, or gym paraphenalia, that's all up to you. Have fun with it!
